## Description

### "Where Am I?" localization Project

 In this project, we utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments.


* Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world

* Utilize the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot

* Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results

* Take screenshots of the result
